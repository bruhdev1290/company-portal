                        Your company must use the data provided for purposes consistent with resolving individual consumer complaints. Your company will keep all consumer complaint data confidential and safeguarded against unintentional disclosures. In particular, your company will not disclose consumer complaint data to anyone other than your company's employees, consultants, and agents for the purpose of consumer complaint processing. If your company receives misaddressed or misrouted information, your company will immediately notify the CFPB and securely destroy the information. If you suspect that an unauthorized user has gained access to consumer complaint data or if you disclose it without authorization, your company will immediately notify the CFPB. In addition, your company will promptly notify the CFPB should an authorized user no longer have authority to access this data and will ensure that such access is terminated. These requirements are not intended to take the place of your company's obligations under federal law to safeguard consumer information.

                        While the CFPB makes reasonable efforts to inform third party complainants of the need to provide proof of third party authorization to your company, the CFPB is not responsible for determining the legal necessity, accuracy or validity of such authorization.
